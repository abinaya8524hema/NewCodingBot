# CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

# DESCRIPTION

  Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
It is Based on Anamoly Detection and by Using Deep Learning Model SOM which is an Unsupervised Learning Method to find patterns followed by the fraudsters.

   Creating a credit card fraud detection program in Python that uses a dataset and provides output is a complex task. Below is a simplified example that you can use as a starting point. We'll use the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled credit card transaction data.


# DATA SET ANALYSIS

This problem has been picked from
Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud


# SOFTWARE

 Then it can be more softwares are using from this project to a program run it easy for softwares are word, excel, microsoft windows, jupyter in firefox.

# INSTALLATION

 Please make sure you have the necessary libraries installed, like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, and that you have the dataset downloaded.

 # PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE
 
python
Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        
plt.show()
